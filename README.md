# COE-328
This repository is for all of the work I've done in COE-328 (Digital Systems) F2020, the course covers basic digital logic circuits with the focus on understanding, creating and simulating such circuits. This is also the 1st course which introduces us to the VHDL programming language.

COE-328 is a Ryerson University course that is mandatory for Computer Engineering students during 3rd semester; I've taken this course during F2020. I would also like to recuse myself of any academic misconduct because the purpose of this repository is to simply show my work, so please do not directly copy.

The application that I've used throughout the course would be Quartus II 13.1.
